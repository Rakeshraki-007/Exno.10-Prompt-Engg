# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

# Report Generation using Query Decomposition + Semantic Filtering

Goal: Generate a report on "AI in Healthcare"

## Prompt (Query Decomposition + Semantic Filtering):

"Break the topic 'AI in Healthcare' into 4 key sections: Introduction, Applications, Benefits and Risks, and Future Trends. Write each section using formal academic tone and avoid generalizations."

## Output Highlights:
Clear structure with section headers

Technical vocabulary used appropriately

Relevant examples and use cases

Avoided vague language due to semantic filter

# Article using Role-based Prompting + Decision-Making
Goal: Write a tech blog article on "The Rise of Edge Computing"

## Prompt (Role-based + Decision-making):

"You are a tech blogger writing for readers with intermediate knowledge in cloud systems. Start with a hook, then explain what edge computing is, compare it to cloud computing, and end with an opinionated insight."

## Output Highlights:
Engaging introduction (hook)

Structured comparison section

Used analogies for explanation

Personal voice in conclusion (opinionated)

# Case Study using Chain-of-Thought + Few-shot Prompting
Goal: Case study on a hospital using AI for diagnosis

## Prompt (Few-shot + CoT):

Example case summary: "Hospital A implemented IBM Watson to improve cancer detection. It increased diagnostic accuracy by 25% in 6 months."
Now, write a similar case study for a fictional hospital using AI in radiology. Explain:

The problem

The AI implementation

Measured outcomes

Lessons learned

## Output Highlights:

Logical, stepwise structure (CoT)

Mimicked the format of the example (few-shot)

Specific metrics and insights

# Comic Book Story using Creative Prompting + Semantic Filtering

Goal: A short comic strip about AI ethics

## Prompt (Creative + Filtering):
"Create a 4-panel comic script featuring a robot named 'AL-E' who learns about data privacy. Make it humorous but informative, and suitable for high school students."

## Output Highlights:

Used humor while embedding key ethical concepts

Age-appropriate vocabulary and tone

Clear visual scene prompts for each panel

# Practical Content Creation Scenarios Using Prompt Patterns

## A. Research Report Example
Topic: "The Impact of AI on Education"
Prompt Strategy: Query Decomposition + Semantic Filtering

"Create a 4-part academic report: (1) Introduction to AI in education, (2) Key applications in classrooms, (3) Benefits and concerns, (4) Conclusion with future outlook. Use formal tone, suitable for university-level readers."

## B. Tech Article Example
Topic: "Edge Computing vs. Cloud Computing"
Prompt Strategy: Role-based + Decision-making

"Act as a tech blogger. Compare edge and cloud computing for enterprise use. Begin with a real-world example, make a comparison table, and recommend one for logistics companies."

## C. Business Case Study Example
Topic: "AI in Retail Inventory Management"
Prompt Strategy: Chain-of-Thought + Few-shot

"Write a structured case study:

Problem: Overstocking and understocking

AI Intervention: Predictive analytics

Outcome: 15% inventory cost reduction
Provide 1-2 similar examples in the conclusion."

## D. Comic Book / Storytelling Example
Topic: "AI Learns Empathy"
Prompt Strategy: Creative Role-based Prompting + Age Filtering

"Write a 6-panel comic script for middle schoolers about an AI robot named 'Eli' that learns empathy after misunderstanding human emotions. Make it humorous but educational."
